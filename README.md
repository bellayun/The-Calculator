# The-Calculator

This is a project based on Udemy course 'Master Python by building 100 projects in 100 days. Learn data science, automation, build websites, games and apps!'.

This project performs calculations between two or more numbers using four operations, *, /, +, -, depending on user requirements.

User inputs one integer number, select which operation they want to use, then input another integer number.
User will get the result, and will be asked if they want to continue calculation.
If the user wants to continue, it will ask the user to select which operation they want to perform, and then ask to input another integer.
Then the calculation will occur with previous result and new input the user entered, and so on.
